# Note Taker

## Description
This assignment required us to use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. I connected the backend with the frontend by using fs and express, and set up various API routes as seen in my server.js file. 

  * GET requests - reads database and return all saved notes as JSON.

  * POST requests - receive new notes to save on the request body, add it to the database file, and then return the new note to the client.

  * DELETE request - receievs the param with the id of a note to delete so it changes in the database file


There is an issue where the note deletes from the database but the html file still has it rendered to the saved notes section, which I am still working on.
